Graph Theory
============

Graph implementation using C. This repository have study purpose only.

The main program is defined on the **graph.c** file.
When compiling the program you should choice which implementation you want to use, for example:

    gcc graph.c adjacency-matrix.c

Adjacency Matrix
----------------
Memory usage: O(n^2)

Verify adjacency between Vi and Vj: O(1)

Visit every arc: O(n^2)
